# Hirschberg's algorithm (CS466 FA20 Final Project)
This project is an implementation of the linear space global sequence alignment algorithm (i.e. [Hirschberg's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirschberg%27s_algorithm)), along with visualizations of alignments, and validation of correctness and memory usage. Our team members are 
Jiali Chen (jialic2), Guangya Wan (guangya2), and Eunice Zhou (xz33).

## Installing & Running
### Installing
Our code resides in a Jupyter Notebook `.ipynb` file, so you can either open the file locally with Jupyter Notebook or open the file using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). You will need to clone this repository and have the `.ipynb` Notebook file locally.

- For instructions for running Jupyter Notebook file locally with JupyterLab, refer to the [JupyterLab installation guide](https://jupyter.org/install).

- For instructions for running Jupyter Notebook file with Google Colab, visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and open the `.ipynb` file as prompted.
